This is my very first project with the turtle module in python and I enjoyed creating this game a lot.

Here is the link to the turtle documentation that has helped me greatly in building this project:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

If you want to recreate this project, you may want to break it in parts such as:
1. Creating the screen 
	- setting its height width and colour using different methods

2. Creating two paddles on two ends and moving them 
	- each of them will be an object of the turtle class and then their shape is modified 
	- using screen.listen(), and screen.onkey() methods

3. Creating a ball and making it move 
	- the ball is another object of the turtle class 
	- by getting the x and y coordinates and increasing it by a small amount, say 10 in a loop the paddles can be moved

4. Detecting collision with the ball and bounce
	- by taking the y coordinates using the ycor() method, checked to see if it touches the end of the screen
	- if yes the bounce method basically multiplies the y increment with -1

5. Detecting collision with paddle
	- by using the distance() method and the xcor() method
	- bounce method is the same as before, multiply the x increment with -1 

6. Detecting misses
	- by checking if the ball surpasses a certain point in the x axis, beyond the paddles

7. Keep Score
	- by using the write() method
	- if left paddle misses, increase the points of the right player by 1
	- if write paddle misses, increase the points of the left player by 1
